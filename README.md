# smallest-synth
i want to build the smallest synthesizer

vision 

* fits in a tiny mints box or something similar
* runs on teensy 4.0
* voices written in faust
  * separate module for master fx?
* 8 voices or more
* no i/o except midi in and audio out
  * power via usb
  * midi in via usb
  * audio out via usb
  * midi in via mini jack (for size)
  * audio out via mini jack (using teensy audio board?)
* completely controlled via midi
  * supporting presets via sysex and stuff (no audio how any of this works)
  * maybe osc is better? who knows
